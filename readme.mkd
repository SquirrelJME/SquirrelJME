# SquirrelJME

**SquirrelJME** is a Java ME 8 Virtual Machine for embedded and Internet of
Things devices. It has the ultimate goal of being 99.9% compatible with the
Java ME standard.

This project is purely written in Java, with a small secondary C project, and 
is very easy to port to different hardware. For running on native hardware, a
compiler handles the conversion of Java byte code to machine code (in an
intermediate format). Any system specific APIs are accessed via standardized
system calls that handle the logic the compiler cannot provide. An execution
engine which is written in C is available and it offers a lightweight method
of code execution.

Additionally, there is a port of SquirrelJME to RetroArch which enables the
ability to play older J2ME software and games designed for flip-phones.

## Goals

 * _To be small_ - Smaller programs are easier to maintain and are usually
   simpler.
 * _To be fast_ - With the potential of AOT/JIT, systems that do not normally
   have a port of an existing virtual machine will usually only have an
   interpreter.
 * _To be compatible_ - So that existing Java ME 8 applications can run on this
   virtual machine, along with J2ME applications when required. This has the
   added bonus of allowing one to use older software to catalog for
   preservation.
 * _To compile once and run anywhere_ - Current and up to date Java
   implementations are limited only to a few select systems (_Solaris_,
   _Linux_, _BSD_, _Mac OS X_, and _Windows_). Java ME 8 as of this writing
   only supports the *FRDM-K64F* and the *Raspberry Pi*. There are multitudes
   of devices that support **J2ME**, however that is horribly out of date when
   compared with the Java that is used today (**J2ME** is equal to Java 1.4
   which was released in _2002_).

100% COMPATIBLE WITH JAVA ME 8. THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO STABLE RELEASED VERSIONS
OF THIS SOFTWARE. AS SUCH THE FIRST MAJOR VERSION RELEASE WILL BE WHEN IT IS
COMPATIBLE SO AS TO NOT VIOLATE POTENTIAL LICENSES, AND IF POSSIBLE BE VERIFIED
WITH ANY APPLICABLE TCKS (SO IT WOULD BE AN "OFFICIAL" IMPLEMENTATION).***
