# RatufaCoat (SquirrelJME)

***RatufaCoat*** is a Java ME Virtual Machine which is capable of running the
SquirrelJME run-time. It is written in C and is intended to be used as an
included library into other programs such as RetroArch. A _SummerCoat Register_
_Format_ ROM is required for this to operate, to which the SquirrelJME project
must be referred to accordingly.
