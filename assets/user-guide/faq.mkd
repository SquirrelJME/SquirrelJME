 * ***Q***: What are the errors with `XX11`?
   * ***A***: To conserve space, **SquirrelJME** uses compactified error
     codes which are stored in an [error directory](error-list.mkd), this is
     so that descriptive messages can be stored externally without there
     being additional space being used by the message.
