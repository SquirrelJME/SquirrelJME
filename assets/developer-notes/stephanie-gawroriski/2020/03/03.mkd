I think the most important part of SpringCoat now is going to be the memory
allocation and simulation. Since I want to make it more like SummerCoat so
that things are a bit easier to debug (and it will probably be faster). So
like SpringCoat will be a refactor but eventually will be able to run my
executed code without needing for me to have loaders and such or whatever.

Also the complexity of SpringCoat is insane, but it could use a refactor and
such.
