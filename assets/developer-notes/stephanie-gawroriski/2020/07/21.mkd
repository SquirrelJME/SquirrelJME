So very nice, I updated RatufaCoat to use CMake and fixed the libRetro build
up a bit. So effectively this means I can use CLion to work on RatufaCoat
with and it should actually make it easier. With the scope of it reduced it
would end up being easier to implement. But there will be a standalone
SDL2 RatufaCoat and then libRetro RatufaCoat. I think that would be the
simplest and easiest to handle.
