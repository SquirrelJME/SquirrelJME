I decided to step away from the LCDUI work to delve into the world security
policies so that `SecurityManager` does useful things. At least to test that
policies work on an application level, I am going to need to able to launch
other MIDlets within SquirrelJME, so I think for now I will just do a native
approach that just has it in shelf so I need not worry about SWM stuff which
does not even support system properties anyway.
