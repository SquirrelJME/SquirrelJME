I really do like doing small one-off commit kind of things. Basically what I
just did was add an alternative means of MIDlet selection so that not just
the first one would be the one that is always ran. This will allow me to try
other MIDlets much more easier in testing.

Also had another idea, I am going to add tags to all of the MIDlets. It will
not be used now, but later on it will be used for ROM selection.
