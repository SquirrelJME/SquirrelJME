Been thinking of RatufaCoat and it would be best to just support the main
systems with SDL2 and additionally with RetroArch. The future AutumnCoat will
have all the native system support for like Palm OS, DOS, and Amiga since I
can build those out myself in Java rather than relying on ancient and very
missing C compilers and libraries.
