I figured out a name for the VBA port of SquirrelJME, it shall be called
BlockyCoat! Since the Visual Basic for Applications logo and otherwise is
very blocky and such.

Okay so I wrote the permission test and it just dies on SpringCoat and I know
it is somewhere in `TreeMap` or at least when it is initialized. So what I
am going to do is have a special debug method that performs trace points and
such.
