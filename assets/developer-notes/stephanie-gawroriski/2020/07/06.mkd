Took a break over the weekend for my birthday (which is today), was working on retro systems and I needed a programming break. So I put down some base classes
for the terminal stuff since it is going to be shared more and there are now
more types of outputs that a task can have (discard, buffered, and terminal).
The output stuff is much better than how I had it before I believe.
