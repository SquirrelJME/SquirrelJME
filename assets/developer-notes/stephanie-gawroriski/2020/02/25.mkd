What I really want to do is merge the simnative stuff into a single module
so that it is not in two places, although `cpp-library` does not seem to
be compatible with `java`. Also I will need to use JavaExec to get the
right name for the simulator library.

I think I get why this is not working with JNI, because this is using a purely
native setup with straight through arguments and such. What I think I need to
do is not have this like it is JNI.
