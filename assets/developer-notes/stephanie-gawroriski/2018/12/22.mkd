Just a few days until release, not going to work on the library at all for the
most part. Since my time was limited it was easier to just not implement all
of LCDUI. Plus I kinda need a faster VM since things are a bit slow with
SpringCoat being a pure interpreter. Having a much faster VM will definitely
improve things and such. Since my testing and running cycle is really slow due
to the speed limit. First I need to go through the cards and prioritize final
things.
