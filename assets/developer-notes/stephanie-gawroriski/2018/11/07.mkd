So having things work is pretty exciting to say the least. It would be nice
to have a super slow LCDUI technical demo running. Although this time around
since I have seen how simplicity has benefited the existing stuff. The
simplicity not having the super complex services code and such. I think it
just ends up being far better to say the least.
