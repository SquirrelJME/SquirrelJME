I had a thought with RMS and SpringCoat, I could do a sort of file system 
translation layer that can exist on disk but is used locally for testing and 
otherwise. It would do its best to not allow breaking out, but would not be
too tightened as it would only be used when testing. That way I can test
reading and writing the RMS data as JSON.
