Fixed a bug in SpringCoat regarding `invokespecial` which I found because of the
C source code writer I have been working on in _wip-nanocoat_. There was an
incompatible class change error when calling `super.__file()` which is package-private
and that was failing. It has been fixed now, which is good. Also more tests and
especially when I work on NanoCoat these small edge cases will be useful.
