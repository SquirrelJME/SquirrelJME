Twitter is possibly collapsing and I do have a bunch of tweets on there for
SquirrelJME that I should record in the notes for a given day, for historical
purposes. I would have to write a parser for Twitter data exports but that
would not be too difficult at all. The only thing would be images and otherwise.
But in the future I should just record in the notes here what I am going to say
anyway since I like having a backup.
