I have been thinking for `wip-l1summercoat` that I am not going to do the C
version of things because that would make save states a bit more difficult and
additionally, TAS support. However, I will still do the hybrid interpreted
environment to figure out the better compiler aspect of things so I do not
need to implement an entire compiler and test it accordingly. I will of course
test things piece by piece.
