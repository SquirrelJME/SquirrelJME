It would be nice to have smart pointers in RatufaCoat, it would simplify cleanup
and otherwise, it would be safer overall. It would require some boilerplate but
hopefully could be done. I suppose it would be like constructor and destructors
and objects. I would essentially just be re-inventing C++... but going C++ is
a mess. I suppose in general it is just a mess anyway.
