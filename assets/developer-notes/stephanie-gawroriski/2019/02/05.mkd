Okay so I figured out what I can do for the various instructions and such,
since I do not want to needlessly duplicate work and things. Right now I have
different instruction indexes for each memory type, but I should really just
have multiple memory types and such. That would be the best. It will still be
pretty fast and even then a future SCRF interpreter could just cache the
results and types or whatever.
