I went to the local library to work on SquirrelJME, it is quite a new
environment. I was going crazy at home. So I think what I need is to have
a kind of argument builder...? Like I want an interpret as kind of thing
placed inside as well... but something safe enough to where it does not
mess up in cases where type safety or breaking Java is concerned. At
times like this, I kinda wish there were tuples easily made and such.
