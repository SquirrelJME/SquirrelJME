Actually I had an idea. I know I had the JVM configuration stuff but what I
could do is just have it in a single class. I would really just need to
execute that class for the most part. That could contain the config data
and it would be very simple because it would just be that object.

The memory code works but is very ugly for the most part, it needs to be
simplified greatly!
