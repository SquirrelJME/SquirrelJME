Now to continue the execution slice debug. I think I want to disable
breakpoints when not debugging and such.

So new problem, when debugging I have no idea what these frames are
like in method calls... So I think on each call I should keep track
of the last instructions called for each frame... because when I go to
print the instructions for things, some frames are really long meaning
that debugging is difficult. So traces will be per frame!
