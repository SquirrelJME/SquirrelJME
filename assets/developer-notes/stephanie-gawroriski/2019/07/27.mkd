Forgot where I was, I worked all week and have not touched or looked at
SquirrelJME at all. I thought I was loading classes, but really I was doing
the dual pooling. Need to see where I am with that.

But I do know that it is only in the minimizer that I have to load the new
class stuff. I need not worry about the actual minimizer and such.
