Since I have a job and like no spare time really, will have to wait until the
weekends and such to work on SquirrelJME. Additionally in the future when I
get the privilidge to work remotely I would be able to work on it before work
and additionally after work (since I would not need to commute I would be less
fried from work). But currently going to mark away the release date for this
one since I do not know what I will be doing in the mean time.
