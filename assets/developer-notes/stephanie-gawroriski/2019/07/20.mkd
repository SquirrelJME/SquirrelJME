Okay so for the constant pool stuff, it is not actually neede... actually I
just had a thought that it is needed. I was saying I did not need aliases
but then that would complicate the pool layout at run-time. The actual
pool values would be from the run-time space. But luckily due to the way
the minimizer works, I can have the static and run-time stuff just done
in a few places as needed.
