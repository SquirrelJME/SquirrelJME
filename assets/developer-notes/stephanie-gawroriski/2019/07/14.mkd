Since I will be using banking for Palm OS, I could actually compress the ROM
chunks so they take up less space. That might be the best solution. I would
need to definitley drop the chunks from their massive 32K size into something
that could potentially compress better. Just major thing is would be to have
it where it is easily be decompressed by RatufaCoat (quick and simple).
