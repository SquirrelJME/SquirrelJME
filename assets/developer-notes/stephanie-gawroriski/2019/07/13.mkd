Okay so I had an idea for RatufaCoat that would help on some more limited
systems and that would be a swap file for the most part. It would be slower
but it would allow more limited systems access to more memory by using the
disk and such. This would effectively allow SquirrelJME to run on DOS,
Palm OS, and the Amiga potentially. It would still work though!
