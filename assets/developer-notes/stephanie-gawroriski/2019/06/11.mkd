Is very cool that I got RetroArch working! Just have been messing with that.
Of course I can continue on doing other things like launching the actual VM

RetroArch support has been improving! Currently going to make it so the basic
ROM can be loaded after the core has been initialized, if it had a missing
chance for example. That way it can still load properly.
