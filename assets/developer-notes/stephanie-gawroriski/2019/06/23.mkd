I need to specify the main class for the launcher as well!

So now pretty much what will be happening to booting the first program and
doing similar stuff to the `BootJAR` although a bit more complicated. To
make it easy and not messy in the CLDC code, I am just going to have all
the loading stuff in the supervisor itself. It can manage all of that no
problem and not too worried about it.

Okay so, I sorted entries in the JAR and also am putting in the hashcode
for each table of contents for resources, will be far better to scan
through them!
