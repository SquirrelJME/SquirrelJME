Did fix a LCDUI bug in text, where things were empty! But other than that I
want to debug my compiler but I am having an issue where I want to convert a
text file to an image so I can draw all over it with my pen. This way I can
have kind of a notepad and drawing into it to help me figure things out.
This is easier than having a separate part of it.

Oh the bits are packed and the format is hybrid binary and text, so that
makes sense why the image looks weird.
