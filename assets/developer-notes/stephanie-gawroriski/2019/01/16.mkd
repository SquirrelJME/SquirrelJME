I was thinking for the graphics stuff, just having hand optimized or similar
Java byte code for the drawing methods just to maximize things and such. Then
use a template with that as well, so it need not be redone over and over
again. Or maybe I am over complicating things with graphics, should I just
force 32-bit? Maybe I am just over complicating things and having too much
variety when the only thing I really need is 32-bit RGB and RGBA.
