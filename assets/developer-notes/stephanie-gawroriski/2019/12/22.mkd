Trying to get SummerCoat or SpringCoat running and I am hitting the class file
issues. There was an error in `Arrays.equals()` which I fixed, that allowed me
to progress further. Now Allocator fails to load because the initial `ALOAD`
has nothing on the stack which is rather wrong. So it is likely a parser error
and such. I do know that `DataInputStream` is used, so maybe that has an
error in it?
