I definitely want to optimize and refactor the JarMinimizer since everything
is in a single class and that is pretty much bad design.

At least then it should be much cleaner and easier to maintain for the most
part, just will be moving the code out and simplifying things greatly.

Okay, so awesome thing is that this refactored code makes much more sense
and is far more readable. Also I am very happy with the table section code
as well!
