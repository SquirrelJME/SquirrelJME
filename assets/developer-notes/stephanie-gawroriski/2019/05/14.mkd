I have an idea to start a new virtual machine which I call FlowerCoat. it will
basically be an optimization of SpringCoat. Pretty much the same pure
interpreter but will allow me to evolve it in a way which fits better with
SummerCoat. Then I can back-port those to SpringCoat. Testing things in
SpringCoat is too slow and SummerCoat although it has a compiler needs a bunch
of supporting VM code and such.
