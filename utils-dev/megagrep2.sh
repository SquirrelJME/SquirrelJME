# DESCRIPTION: A more efficient but a more search chaotic grep of every single
# file in the repository
# The results are output based on their artifact ID and not the revision they
# are in, so all files are treated special

# Force C locale
export LC_ALL=C

# Directory of this script
__exedir="$(dirname -- "$0")"

# Trigger to indicate that the request is being made, since it can take awhile
printf '%s' "...generating request..." 1>&2
__requested=0

# The HTTP interface allows one to get the list of all the blobs, however
# it is honypotted but despite that it still has the needed information.
# It is however in HTTP format. But html2text allows very plain text to be
# output, which means it is easier to parse
# The output is in the format of:
#  1044 613351de24 file src/extra-io/net/multiphasicapps/io/BitInputStream.java
# So these lines must be detected
