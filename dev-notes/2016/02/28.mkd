Ant is going to get a bit complex, so I suppose I need a kind of mini hairball
that is very light for this to work.

What I really need though is a generator for build.xmls which I can recurse
into when compling things potentially.

I believe I am going to use a shell script instead, this would be limited to
building on UNIX like systems only however. But on non-UNIX systems this would
prove a bit more difficult. I can do something similar to Squirrnix and have
a compilation of a basic system which builds things.

I never realized that `LinkedList` was a `Deque`, that is pretty nice.

The one thing I am missing though is the lack of unmodifiable collections. I
will need to duplicate that for certain cases.

Looks like JavaME has something called liblets now, this means that there is
no longer a need to cram entire libraries into a single JAR and now it can just
reuse pre-existing ones.
