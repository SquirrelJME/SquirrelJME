# Contributing

Before you contribute you should read and understand the [license](license.mkd)
that SquirrelJME is under. You should abide by the
[Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.mkd), if you fail to keep the pledge your
contribution will not be accepted since it can create a toxic and unwelcoming
environment for developers and users.

 * For instructions on building, see [this document](building.mkd).
 * Please read the [developer guide](developer-guide.mkd)!

Development can happen on any operating system, however most of the scripts are
developed targeting Unix compatible systems, this means the following:

 * Linux
 * BSD
 * Mac OS X
 * Cygwin or WSL (Windows)

SquirrelJME uses the [Fossil](https://fossil-scm.org/) source control
system and as such it generally is expected that it is to be used. There also
are [GitHub Pull Requests](https://github.com/SquirrelJME/SquirrelJME/pulls)
however since the Git is a mirror, when these are merged there will not be
an indication that they were merged because any writes to the Git repository
will be destroyed.
