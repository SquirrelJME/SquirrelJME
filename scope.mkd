# The Scope of SquirrelJME

This document defines the scope of SquirrelJME, classes which are to be
supported and ones which are not to be supported. All of the listed
specifications are either planned to be implemented, considering, or out
of scope for the project.

# To Implement

These are specifications which are to be implemented to provide the base
functionality for SquirrelJME.

## Specifications

All of these listed specifications are not obsolete or implemented by other
specifications.

 * **JSR184** -- Mobile 3D Graphics API for J2ME
   * Needed by a number of games.
 * **JSR211** -- Content Handler API
   * Content handling, essentially say you install a JAR that is a media
     player for MIDI files. Effectively if you "launch" a MIDI, that given JAR
     will open to view the given content.
 * **JSR226** -- Scalable 2D Vector Graphics API for J2ME 1.1
   * SVG Tiny Support.
   * Relies on LCDUI.

   * Sensors are useful.
 * **JSR271** -- Mobile Information Device Profile 3
   * Enhances support for MIDlets by adding more features.

# Considering

Specifications that may be considered for inclusion.

## Specifications

 * **JSR120** -- Java(TM) Wireless Messaging API Specification 1.1
   * Supports SMS, USSD, and CBS.
   * Uses GCF.
 * **JSR179** -- Location API for J2ME.
   * Locating of users via GPS and other such things.

   * Similar to Palm OS's HotSync.
 * **JSR257** -- Contactless Communication API
   * Can be used for RFID and such.
   * May also include NFC.

# Out of Scope

These specifications will be not be implement at all. Note however, that
although these specifications are out of scope may potentially be provided by
third parties libraries.

## Specifications

 * **JSR062** -- Personal Profile Specification.
   * Effectively Java SE Embedded.
 * **JSR066** -- RMI Optional Package Specification Version 1.0.
   * Requires CDC.
 * **JSR068** -- J2ME Platform Specification
   * Withdrawn.
   * Based on the description it uses "building blocks" which could also be
     known as profiles. SquirrelJME already has such things in the project
     system.
 * **JSR129** -- Personal Basis Profile Specification
   * Effectively Java SE Embedded.
 * **JSR169** -- JDBC Optional Package for CDC/Foundation Profile
   * Requires CDC.

   * Designed for both CLDC and CDC.
 * **JSR177** -- Security and Trust Services API for J2ME
   * Some classes are partially handled by other implemented JSRs.
 * **JSR178** -- Mobile Game API
   * Withdrawn.
   * Based on the description it would essentially be a game library with
     multiplayer APIs, collisions, vector graphics, and a physics engine.
 * **JSR180** -- SIP API for J2ME.
   * Voice calls.
   * Uses GCF.
   * This is really handled best by third party providers.
 * **JSR197** -- Generic Connection Framework Optional Package for J2SE.
   * Not J2ME related, however it is included to reduce confusion.
   * Makes it so Java SE can use GCF.
 * **JSR209** -- Advanced Graphics and User Interface.
   * Effectively Java SE Embedded.
 * **JSR213** -- Micro WSCI Framework for J2ME.
   * Rejected.
   * More nasty XML.
   * Requires CDC.

   * Effectively Java SE with Java ME bits.
 * **JSR229** -- Payment API
   * Used for monetary transactions.

   * Effectively java SE.
   * Has TV stuff.
 * **JSR272** -- Mobile Broadcast Service API for Handheld Terminals 1.0
   * This is for broadcast services, which is completley out of scope.
 * **JSR302** -- Safety Critical Java Technology
   * Essentially JSR001 for J2ME.
   * Real time does not always mean safe.
 * **JSR324** -- On Screen MIDlet API for Java ME
   * Rejected.
   * Essentially stuff related to the idle screen, likely similar to MIDP 3.
 * **JSR325** -- IMS Communication Enablers
   * Essentially VoIP.
 * **JSR332** -- Email Client API for Java ME
   * E-mail.
 * **JSR927** -- Java TV API 1.1
   * Depends upon _JSR127_ (Personal Basis Profile).
   * Precedes _BD-J_.
   * Includes `javax.tv.xlet`.
 * **BD-J** -- Blu-ray Disc Java (Blu-ray Disc Association)
   * Extends on Java TV (includes the Personal Basis Profile).
   * Not a JSR, standardized by the specified association.

# Unknown

These are specifications which the understanding of them is not enough to
evaluate them completely for inclusion or exclusion.

## Specifications

 * **JSR190** -- Event Tracking API for J2ME
   * IPDR/SP? Internet Protocol Detail Record.
   * Not sure if this is for events that happen (say temperature changes) or
     if something bad happens to hardware.
