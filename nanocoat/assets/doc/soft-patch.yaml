title: SquirrelJME Soft-Patch YAML Schema
description: |
 Allows for software side patching of Java applications running on the
 SquirrelJME virtual machine so that modifications to the original pristine
 Jar are not required. This allows you to change the behavior of methods,
 add new fields, add new methods, and otherwise accordingly. This may be used
 to fix bugs, add back in missing functionality, or otherwise.
